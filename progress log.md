## 24/01/2026

## 25/01/2026
Added further questions for the meeting and clarified them.  
Read the paper about anonymised data in full.

## 28/01/2026
Set up the meeting with the degree project coordinators.  

## 29/01/2026
Created an R script that used an existing data set from `biostats3` package to model the data for the project.   
Applied the proposed approach and midpoint imputation to the modified data set.  
Fitted the Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models on imputed data.  

## 30/01/2026
Created an R script that generated survival data from a distribution and modified it to model a real-world study.  
Applied the proposed approach to build a model on the modified data set.  
Compared different parametric models resulting from the proposed approach by plotting the fitted distributions.  
Uploaded R scripts to GitHub.  
Wrote about common survival time distributions.  
Wrote down the formula for the Wilson confidence interval.
